            <h3>Artifact Description</h3>
            <p>
                The Artifact I’ve chosen is the Travlr Getaways project. It is a full-stack / MEAN-stack 
                booking platform originally developed during the course: CS-465 Full Stack Development 
                last semester. during the course I followed a guide on MEAN-stack (MongoDB, Express.js, 
                Angular, Node.js), the application features both a customer-facing website for browsing 
                travel destinations with an administrative interface through angular for managing data 
                within the database. The artifact represents a full-stack solution with server-side 
                rendering via Handlebars templates, RESTful API endpoints, and database integrations.

            <h3>Justification for Inclusion</h3>
            <p>
                I selected this artifact for my ePortfolio because full-stack is considered the bread and 
                butter of software engineering design. It branches out into other categories such as frontend, 
                backend, databases, and GitHub collaboration or CI/CDs. Website, program, and database curation 
                is needed in many different online facets. (Like Oil & Gas, Medical, Logistics, shipping, IT 
                firms branching to mom&pops)
            </p>
        
            <h4>The Problem:</h4>
            <p>
                The original templates were designed for a static HTML with exactly three travel destinations. 
                When the application was converted to use Handlebars templating and MongoDB for dynamic content 
                and data addition / editing, a layout flaw in the website’s UI appeared, adding more than three 
                trips to the database (because 3 was the original default amount) caused a visual problem, Images 
                began overlapping with the separator lines and the white space between them was inconsistent, and 
                the appearance lost professionality. 
            </p>

            <h4>The Solution:</h4>
            <p>
                Through debugging, file searching, and general understanding of the full-stack environment, I 
                identified a few CSS issues that caused this problem.
            </p>
            
            <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
                <li><strong>Issue 1: Float Containment Failure:</strong> The images used <code>float: right;</code> 
                    to position themselves, but the parent <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> containers couldn't properly contain 
                    these floated children. This caused container height collapse and overlapping content as more items 
                    were added.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
                <strong>Solution:</strong> I added <code>overflow: hidden;</code> to <code>#sites li</code>, which 
                created a block formatting context that forces the parent container to acknowledge and contain its 
                floated children.
            </p>
            
            <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
                <li><strong>Issue 2: Inconsistent Padding Accumulation:</strong> The template applied <code>24px</code> 
                    bottom padding to every <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag via <code>#contents p</code>. The original three 
                    static entries each had two paragraph tags, creating consistent spacing. However, new database entries 
                    with different description lengths accumulated different amounts of padding, resulting in uneven visual 
                    rhythm.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
                <strong>Solution:</strong> Removed the paragraph-level bottom padding and instead applied uniform <code>30px 
                padding-bottom</code> to the <code>#sites li</code> containers themselves, ensuring consistent spacing regardless 
                of content length or number of paragraphs.
            </p>
            

            <h4 style="margin-top: 25px;">Skills Demonstrated:</h4>
            <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
                <li><strong>Problem analysis:</strong> Identifying the root cause of the website’s formatting failure, pinning 
                    it down to the structure of the file structure, and pinning it to the CSS layout failure in content that 
                    was not made to be future proof.</li>
                <li><strong>Frontend Engineering:</strong> Understanding CSS box model, float behavior, and block formatting 
                    contexts.</li>
                <li><strong>Scalability Thinking:</strong> Recognizing that a design working with static data may fail when 
                    connected to a dynamic database.</li>
                <li><strong>Modern Design Principles:</strong> Applying Material Design 3 for professional, 
                    cohesive interfaces</li>
                <li><strong>Code Investigation:</strong> Tracing through cascading stylesheet to understand how multiple 
                    selectors interact. </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Layout After Enhancement:</h4>

            <div class="screenshot">
                <img src="images/LayoutAfter.png"
                    alt="Original trip layout with overlapping images"
                    style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ddd; margin: 20px 0;">
            </div>
            
            <h3>Another Problem:</h3>
            <p>
                I found another problem that started with a UI/UX problem. The Angular admin interface, started 
                with a typo in trip-card.html where the Delete button used btnbtn-danger, which is a typo, it 
                should be  btn btn-danger, so it rendered as a bland looking black-and-white square. Additionally, 
                the default bootstrap btn-info turquoise comes off a bit ugly and there is even some unprofessional 
                spacing resembling an early 2000s web design rather than anything even remotely modern. 
            </p>

            <h4>Angular Interface Before Enhancement:</h4>
                        
            <div class="screenshot">
                <img src="images/AngularLayoutBefore.png"
                    alt="Original trip layout with overlapping images"
                    style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ddd; margin: 20px 0;">
            </div>
            <p>I’m a huge fan of Material Design 3 principles, I’m no expert, but I like the idea of cleaning up an 
                interface. My solution involved:</p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
                <li><strong>Button Styling:</strong> Replaced Bootstrap defaults with Material 3 guidance through the CSS. 
                    I added a higher radius (<code>8px</code>), subtle shadows, and letter-spacing for a polished look.</li>
                <li><strong>Color Hierarchy:</strong> Primary actions (Edit/Add Trip) use solid blue buttons, while 
                    destructive actions (Delete Trip) use outlined red buttons which mimic other professional designs 
                    from other websites.</li>
                <li><strong>Layout Consistency:</strong> I implemented flexbox across <code>trip-listing.css</code> and 
                    <code>trip-card.css</code> to ensure equal card heights and bottom-aligned buttons, eliminating awkward 
                    spacing caused by varying description lengths.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Angular Interface After Enhancement</h4>
            <div class="screenshot">
                <img src="images/AngularLayoutAfter.png"
                    alt="Original trip layout with overlapping images"
                    style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ddd; margin: 20px 0;">
            </div>
            
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
                The primary lesson was that designs optimized for static content often fail catastrophically 
                when connected to dynamic databases. Scalable UI must be considered from the start or carefully 
                retrofitted later. I learned how CSS cascades through component hierarchies in Angular—making 
                buttons align properly required understanding how flexbox properties flow through multiple DOM 
                levels: Bootstrap columns, Angular component wrappers, card containers, and card bodies. Missing 
                any link in this chain broke the layout.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also gained practical experience with Material Design 3 principles, which provided a framework 
                for intentional design decisions rather than arbitrary aesthetic choices. Understanding concepts 
                like elevation, visual hierarchy, and spacing systems made the enhancement process more defensible 
                and professional.
            </p>

            <h4>Challenges Faced</h4>
            <p>
                The primary technical challenge was overriding Bootstrap's opinionated defaults without affecting 
                other parts of the application. Custom styles needed careful specificity management to take 
                precedence appropriately.
            </p>
            <p>
                The card alignment issue proved particularly frustrating—conceptually simple (make cards the same 
                height) but technically complex due to nested container behavior. Buttons floated wherever 
                description text ended, requiring coordinated CSS changes in both <code>trip-listing.css</code> 
                and <code>trip-card.css</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
                There was also a learning curve in articulating <em>why</em> design choices matter beyond 
                aesthetics. Inconsistent button placements create cognitive friction for users scanning multiple 
                cards. Recognizing and addressing these UX concerns represents the difference between functional 
                code and professional software.
            </p>

            <h4>Course Outcomes Addressed</h4>
            <p>
                <strong>Outcome 2 - Professional-Quality Visual Communication:</strong> The layout issues 
                compromised the application's professional appearance and organizational credibility. By ensuring 
                consistent visual presentation across both customer and admin interfaces, I created a coherent, 
                technically sound interface that adapts appropriately to dynamic content. The documented 
                before/after improvements demonstrate my ability to communicate technical changes clearly.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Outcome 4 - Well-Founded Techniques, Skills & Tools:</strong> I employed established CSS 
                principles (block formatting contexts, cascade, specificity) to diagnose root causes, researched 
                and applied Material Design 3 standards, and implemented scalable solutions that function 
                regardless of database size. The enhancement follows debugging best practices and delivers 
                tangible value through improved usability and professionalism.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Outcome 3 - Design and Evaluate Computing Solutions:</strong> While this enhancement 
                focused primarily on presentation layer improvements rather than algorithmic optimization, the 
                overflow fix demonstrates evaluating solutions using computer science best practices while 
                managing real-world design constraints. The solution addressed immediate problems while 
                maintaining compatibility with the existing codebase and minimizing risk of introducing new bugs.
