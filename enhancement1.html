            <h3>Artifact Description</h3>
            <p>
                The Artifact I’ve chosen is the Travlr Getaways project. It is a full-stack / MEAN-stack 
                booking platform originally developed during the course: CS-465 Full Stack Development 
                last semester. during the course I followed a guide on MEAN-stack (MongoDB, Express.js, 
                Angular, Node.js), the application features both a customer-facing website for browsing 
                travel destinations with an administrative interface through angular for managing data 
                within the database. The artifact represents a full-stack solution with server-side 
                rendering via Handlebars templates, RESTful API endpoints, and database integrations.  
            </p>

        </section>

        <section id="justification">
            <h3>Justification for Inclusion</h3>
            <p>
                I selected this artifact for my ePortfolio because full-stack is considered the bread and 
                butter of software engineering design. It branches out into other categories such as frontend, 
                backend, databases, and GitHub collaboration or CI/CDs. Website, program, and database curation 
                is needed in many different online facets. (Like Oil & Gas, Medical, Logistics, shipping, IT 
                firms branching to mom&pops)
            </p>
        
            <h3>The Problem</h3>
            <p>
                The original templates were designed for a static HTML with exactly three travel destinations. 
                When the application was converted to use Handlebars templating and MongoDB for dynamic content 
                and data addition / editing, a layout flaw in the website’s UI appeared, adding more than three 
                trips to the database (because 3 was the original default amount) caused a visual problem, Images 
                began overlapping with the separator lines and the white space between them was inconsistent, and 
                the appearance lost professionality. 
            </p>

            <div class="screenshot">
                <img src="images/LayoutBefore.png"
                    alt="Original trip layout with overlapping images"
                    style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ddd; margin: 20px 0;">
            </div>

            <h4>The Solution:</h4>
            <p>
                Through debugging, file searching, and general understanding of the full-stack environment, I 
                identified a few CSS issues that caused this problem.
            </p>
            
            <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
                <li><strong>Issue 1: Float Containment Failure:</strong> The images used <code>float: right;</code> 
                    to position themselves, but the parent <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> containers couldn't properly contain 
                    these floated children. This caused container height collapse and overlapping content as more items 
                    were added.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
                <strong>Solution:</strong> I added <code>overflow: hidden;</code> to <code>#sites li</code>, which 
                created a block formatting context that forces the parent container to acknowledge and contain its 
                floated children.
            </p>
            
            <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
                <li><strong>Issue 2: Inconsistent Padding Accumulation:</strong> The template applied <code>24px</code> 
                    bottom padding to every <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag via <code>#contents p</code>. The original three 
                    static entries each had two paragraph tags, creating consistent spacing. However, new database entries 
                    with different description lengths accumulated different amounts of padding, resulting in uneven visual 
                    rhythm.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
                <strong>Solution:</strong> Removed the paragraph-level bottom padding and instead applied uniform <code>30px 
                padding-bottom</code> to the <code>#sites li</code> containers themselves, ensuring consistent spacing regardless 
                of content length or number of paragraphs.
            </p>

            <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
                <li><strong>Problem analysis:</strong> Identifying the root cause of the website’s formatting failure, pinning 
                    it down to the structure of the file structure, and pinning it to the CSS layout failure in content that 
                    was not made to be future proof.</li>
                <li><strong>Frontend Engineering:</strong> Understanding CSS box model, float behavior, and block formatting 
                    contexts.</li>
                <li><strong>Scalability Thinking:</strong> Recognizing that a design working with static data may fail when 
                    connected to a dynamic database.</li>
                <li><strong>Modern Design Principles:</strong> Applying Material Design 3 for professional, 
                    cohesive interfaces</li>
                <li><strong>Code Investigation:</strong> Tracing through cascading stylesheet to understand how multiple 
                    selectors interact. </li>

            <h3>Another Problem</h3>
            <p>
                I found another problem that started with a UI/UX problem. The Angular admin interface, started 
                with a typo in trip-card.html where the Delete button used btnbtn-danger, which is a typo, it 
                should be  btn btn-danger, so it rendered as a bland looking black-and-white square. Additionally, 
                the default bootstrap btn-info turquoise comes off a bit ugly and there is even some unprofessional 
                spacing resembling an early 2000s web design rather than anything even remotely modern. 
            </p>

            <h4>Angular Interface Before Enhancement:</h4>
                        
            <div class="screenshot">
                <img src="images/AngularLayoutBefore.png"
                    alt="Original trip layout with overlapping images"
                    style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ddd; margin: 20px 0;">
            </div>
            <p>I’m a huge fan of Material Design 3 principles, I’m no expert, but I like the idea of cleaning up an 
                interface. My solution involved:</p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
                <li><strong>Button Styling:</strong> Replaced Bootstrap defaults with Material 3 guidance through the CSS. 
                    I added a higher radius (<code>8px</code>), subtle shadows, and letter-spacing for a polished look.</li>
                <li><strong>Color Hierarchy:</strong> Primary actions (Edit/Add Trip) use solid blue buttons, while 
                    destructive actions (Delete Trip) use outlined red buttons which mimic other professional designs 
                    from other websites.</li>
                <li><strong>Layout Consistency:</strong> I implemented flexbox across <code>trip-listing.css</code> and 
                    <code>trip-card.css</code> to ensure equal card heights and bottom-aligned buttons, eliminating awkward 
                    spacing caused by varying description lengths.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 style="margin-top: 20px;">Angular Interface After Enhancement:</h4>
            <div class="screenshot">
                <img src="images/AngularLayoutAfter.png"
                    alt="Original trip layout with overlapping images"
                    style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ddd; margin: 20px 0;">
            </div>

            <h3>Course Outcomes</h3>
            <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
                <li><strong>Outcome 2: Professional-Quality Visual Communication:</strong> I’ve demonstrated this through 
                    the delivery of proper visual communications. The layout issues compromised the application’s professional 
                    appearance, which would negatively impact user perception and organizational credibility. by ensuring consistent 
                    visual presentation in both the button layout and database content, I’ve created a coherent, technical sound 
                    interface that adapts appropriately to dynamic content. The before/after screenshots in this narrative demonstrate 
                    my ability to document technical improvements in a visually clear manner for audiences.</li>
                <li><strong>Outcome 4: Well-Founded Techniques, Skills & Tools:</strong> I employed things like CSS principles (block 
                    formatting contexts, cascade, specificity) to diagnose root causes. Researched Material Design 3 standards. Implemented 
                    scalable solutions that works regardless of database size, ensuring the application delivers values as content grows, 
                    followed debugging best practices: hypothesis formation, systematic testing, and incremental changes, modern CSS layout 
                    systems (flexbox for equal height cards), visual hierarchy (clear action differentiation). Adding tangible value by 
                    making the interface more usable and professional looking. </li>
                <li><strong>Outcome 3: Design and Evaluate Computing Solutions: :</strong> Was not the primary focus of this section, I focused 
                    mostly on presentation layer improvements rather than algorithmic optimizations or security hardening. There were minimal 
                    code changes, and the most extensive type of refactoring was the flexbox modernization with testing across the entire template. 
                    The overflow method on the other hand provided some coding best practices because it provided a fix to an immediate problem while 
                    maintaining compatibility with the existing codebase, and minimizing the risk of introducing new bugs, demonstrating my ability 
                    to evaluate solutions using computer science best practices while managing real-world design constraints, but it’s not exactly 
                    a core algorithm-based improvement. </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            
                <p>
                    <strong>What did I learn:</strong> What I learned was some basic CSS and HTML tweaking and functionality. In terms of the trip display problem, 
                    I learned that Static vs Dynamic template designs often fail when connected to databases, and scalable UI implementations must 
                    be considered, whether or not they can be done so from the beginning or retrofitted later for the separate Frontend Developer is 
                    another question. On the Button side however, my original implementation involved work that primarily focused on backend perspectives, 
                    all the CRUD operations functioned correctly, but the interface had some problems that looked amateurish, even including a single typo 
                    (btnbtn-danger) and used default colors from Bootstrap.
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    I learned how CSS cascades through component hierarchies in Angular. Making the card buttons align properly required understanding of 
                    systems like flexbox properties needing to flow through multiple HTML levels: the Bootstrap column (col-md-4), the Angular component 
                    wrapper (app-trip-card), the card container (.card), and finally the card body (.card-body). Missing any link in the chain broke the layout. 
                    This taught me to think about DOM structure and style inheritance similar to how the trip display problem provided a spacing issue that required 
                    understanding of paragraph padding rules defined by the site’s specific rules. Learning this process also allows me to find out that my initial 
                    assumption that spacing issues were image-specific was incorrect. By testing hypotheses and tracing through the cascade, I discovered the true 
                    problem was content-driven padding accumulation rather.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I also learned about Material Design 3 during my android development course. The principles provide a foundational framework for making design 
                    decisions rather than just guessing and copying blindly off of other popular designs. (even though M3 is a popular guide regardless). Still though, 
                    understanding concepts like elevation (subtle shadows), visual hierarchy (solid vs. outlined buttons for primary vs. destructive actions), and spacing 
                    systems made the enhancement process more intentional and defensible.
                </p>

            <h3>Challenges Faced</h3>
            <p>
                the primary technical challenge was overriding Bootstrap’s opinionated defaults. It wasn’t really a hard challenge but utility classes (btn-info, btn-danger) 
                come with built-in styling that I wanted to override without affecting other parts of the application. I had to learn CSS on the fly, since I didn’t cover it 
                at all during the course, but it was critical to ensure my custom styles took precedence.
            </p>

            <p>
                The card alignment issue was particularly frustrating because the solution seemed simple conceptually (just make them the same height) but, I ended up just 
                using a flexbox to distribute space across nested containers. The buttons weren’t anchored to the card itself – they floated wherever the description text ended 
                which had varying lengths. Solving this required CSS in both trip-listing.css (for the column layout) and trip-card.css (for the card internals), which wasn’t 
                immediately obvious.
            </p>

            <p>
                Finally, there was a learning curve in articulating why certain design choices even mattered. It’s one thing to notice whether or not something looks awkward, 
                but another is to understand if it might look awkward or hard to decern to others. Inconsistent button placements create some cognitive friction for users who 
                need to scan multiple cards quickly. This enhancement will fix that I believe, while I don’t have access to other opinions or test runs, it’s considered common 
                practice in most frontend development sectors who balance aesthetics, usability, and technical implementation.
