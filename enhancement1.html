            <h3>Artifact Description</h3>
            <p>
                The artifact selected for this enhancement is the Travlr Getaways full-stack booking platform, 
                originally developed in CS-465 (Full Stack Development) in fall 2024. This MEAN stack application 
                (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js) features both a customer-facing website for browsing 
                travel destinations and an administrative interface for managing database content. The application 
                implements server-side rendering via Handlebars templates, RESTful API endpoints, and MongoDB 
                integration, representing a complete full-stack solution.

            <h3>Justification for Inclusion</h3>
            <p>
                I selected this artifact because full-stack development represents the foundation of modern 
                software engineering, integrating frontend, backend, databases, and deployment considerations. 
                These skills are essential across industries—from logistics and healthcare to e-commerce and 
                enterprise applications.
            </p>

            <h4>The Problem</h4>
            <p>
                The original templates were designed for exactly three static travel destinations. When the 
                application was converted to use dynamic content from MongoDB, a critical layout flaw emerged: 
                adding more than three trips caused images to overlap separator lines, created inconsistent 
                whitespace, and degraded the professional appearance of the interface.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, the Angular admin interface contained a typo (<code>btnbtn-danger</code> instead 
                of <code>btn btn-danger</code>) that rendered the Delete button as an unstyled element, and the 
                default Bootstrap styling appeared dated and unprofessional.
            </p>

            <h4>The Solution</h4>
            <p>
                Through systematic debugging and investigation of the CSS cascade, I identified and resolved 
                multiple issues:
            </p>

            <p><strong>Trip Display Fix:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Float Containment Failure:</strong> Images used <code>float: right;</code> but parent 
                    <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> containers couldn't contain floated children, causing height collapse. 
                    Solution: Added <code>overflow: hidden;</code> to create a block formatting context.</li>
                <li><strong>Inconsistent Padding:</strong> Different content lengths accumulated different amounts 
                    of padding. Solution: Moved padding from individual <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags to uniform 
                    <code>30px padding-bottom</code> on <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> containers.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Admin Interface Redesign:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fixed the button typo</li>
                <li>Implemented Material Design 3 principles: increased border radius (8px), subtle shadows, 
                    proper letter-spacing</li>
                <li>Established color hierarchy: solid blue for primary actions (Edit/Add), outlined red for 
                    destructive actions (Delete)</li>
                <li>Applied flexbox layouts to ensure equal card heights and bottom-aligned buttons regardless 
                    of description length</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Skills Demonstrated</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Problem Analysis:</strong> Root cause diagnosis in complex CSS cascades</li>
                <li><strong>Frontend Engineering:</strong> Understanding CSS box model, float behavior, and 
                    block formatting contexts</li>
                <li><strong>Scalability Thinking:</strong> Recognizing when static designs fail with dynamic data</li>
                <li><strong>Modern Design Principles:</strong> Applying Material Design 3 for professional, 
                    cohesive interfaces</li>
                <li><strong>Systematic Debugging:</strong> Hypothesis formation, testing, and incremental changes</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="reflection">
            <h3>Reflection on the Enhancement Process</h3>

            <h4>What I Learned</h4>
            <p>
                The primary lesson was that designs optimized for static content often fail catastrophically 
                when connected to dynamic databases. Scalable UI must be considered from the start or carefully 
                retrofitted later. I learned how CSS cascades through component hierarchies in Angular—making 
                buttons align properly required understanding how flexbox properties flow through multiple DOM 
                levels: Bootstrap columns, Angular component wrappers, card containers, and card bodies. Missing 
                any link in this chain broke the layout.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also gained practical experience with Material Design 3 principles, which provided a framework 
                for intentional design decisions rather than arbitrary aesthetic choices. Understanding concepts 
                like elevation, visual hierarchy, and spacing systems made the enhancement process more defensible 
                and professional.
            </p>

            <h4>Challenges Faced</h4>
            <p>
                The primary technical challenge was overriding Bootstrap's opinionated defaults without affecting 
                other parts of the application. Custom styles needed careful specificity management to take 
                precedence appropriately.
            </p>
            <p>
                The card alignment issue proved particularly frustrating—conceptually simple (make cards the same 
                height) but technically complex due to nested container behavior. Buttons floated wherever 
                description text ended, requiring coordinated CSS changes in both <code>trip-listing.css</code> 
                and <code>trip-card.css</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
                There was also a learning curve in articulating <em>why</em> design choices matter beyond 
                aesthetics. Inconsistent button placements create cognitive friction for users scanning multiple 
                cards. Recognizing and addressing these UX concerns represents the difference between functional 
                code and professional software.
            </p>

            <h4>Course Outcomes Addressed</h4>
            <p>
                <strong>Outcome 2 - Professional-Quality Visual Communication:</strong> The layout issues 
                compromised the application's professional appearance and organizational credibility. By ensuring 
                consistent visual presentation across both customer and admin interfaces, I created a coherent, 
                technically sound interface that adapts appropriately to dynamic content. The documented 
                before/after improvements demonstrate my ability to communicate technical changes clearly.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Outcome 4 - Well-Founded Techniques, Skills & Tools:</strong> I employed established CSS 
                principles (block formatting contexts, cascade, specificity) to diagnose root causes, researched 
                and applied Material Design 3 standards, and implemented scalable solutions that function 
                regardless of database size. The enhancement follows debugging best practices and delivers 
                tangible value through improved usability and professionalism.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Outcome 3 - Design and Evaluate Computing Solutions:</strong> While this enhancement 
                focused primarily on presentation layer improvements rather than algorithmic optimization, the 
                overflow fix demonstrates evaluating solutions using computer science best practices while 
                managing real-world design constraints. The solution addressed immediate problems while 
                maintaining compatibility with the existing codebase and minimizing risk of introducing new bugs.
