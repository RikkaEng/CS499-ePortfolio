            <h3>Intro</h3>
            <p>
                Completing Computer Science at Southern New Hampshire has honestly felt like a much-needed introduction to the field. I feel 
                like I’ve only scratched the surface, which is indicative to how I felt when I graduated from The University of Texas in San 
                Antonio with a Mechanical Engineering degree, the only difference is that I have more motivation to dig deep into the field, as 
                I find computers, modern technology, software-based problem solving to be more inline with my creative interests and analytical 
                strengths. 
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="collaboration">
            <h3>Collaboration and Stakeholder Communication</h3>
            <p>
                On the coding side throughout the program, I’ve gained a consistent narrative amongst many instructors and tutors, that I should 
                prioritize writing code with clear, contextual comments, not just for my future self, but for the potential that anyone else who 
                might read my code might later want to understand it. I’ve learned that good commenting and method naming isn’t about explaining 
                what the code does, but rather explaining in a way that’s easy to digest, quick, and easy to familiarize and navigate. 
            </p>
            <p>
                the course has also invested time into having me familiarize myself with GitHub’s collaborative features, Pages for portfolio 
                hosting, Copilot for assisted development, branch management, and pull request workflows, even though I haven’t yet used these 
                in team contexts, I at least understand the tools and can conceptualize collaborative efforts that can be integrated into 
                development between teams effectively.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, however I intend to prepare for collaborative environments by studying real-world documentation practices. I’ve begun 
                analyzing publicly available projects and codebases from companies in my area that are actively hiring on Indeed, examining 
                their documentation styles, code comment structures, and architectural decision records. My goal is to familiarize myself with 
                industry-standard practices before entering professional settings. While I lack extensive team collaboration experience currently, 
                I’ve considered the steps that need to be taken to ensure I can contribute effectively to collaborative codebases when the 
                opportunity arises.

        <section id="Data S+A">
            <h3>Data Structures and Algorithms:</h3>
            <p>
                My understanding of algorithms was primarily done through the course CS-255 System Analysis and Design, it was where Big O notation, 
                tree structures, and search algorithms was introduced. I only studied it on a surface level, and was only able to apply it to 
                practical applications like simple database retrieval methods and my personal Travlr Getaway MEAN-stack project that I did in my 
                full-stack course via MongoDB text indexes implementations to optimize queries from an O(n) to Log( n) complexity. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I’m aware that simply knowing binary search trees and hash tables exist is just a first step, what matters more is understanding why 
                they’re useful, like outside of the curriculum I discovered bitmasking as a strong solution for managing multiple Boolean flags 
                effectively.
            </p>
            <p>
                bitmasking is a strategy to manage multiple true/false states in a optimized way. For example, in a video game with user permissions 
                like (canEdit, canDelete, isAdmin), traditional implementations might store four separate Boolean fields for the permission table, but 
                bitmasking can do all four stages with a single integer: like the file can be stored as 0b1010, which would loosely translate to 
                canEdit=true, canDelete=false, canShare=true, isAdmin=false. Or in other words, checking a permission becomes a simple O(1) operation 
                because it’s just scanning the location and binary option (0 or 1) or the string.
            </p>
            <p>
                This technique would be particularly valuable in systems handling real-time state updates, such as multiplayer game servers tracking 
                thousands of player states simultaneously, or role-based access control systems where permission checks occur on every API request. 
                The memory efficiency and computational speed of bitwise operations make them ideal for high-throughput scenarios where traditional 
                boolean fields or relational lookups would create bottlenecks. While I haven't implemented bitmasking in production code yet, 
                understanding these advanced optimization patterns demonstrates that effective algorithm design isn't just about implementing textbook 
                solutions—it's about recognizing when unconventional approaches solve specific problems more elegantly.

        <section id="Database Management">
            <h3>Software Engineering and Database Management:</h3>
            <p>
                The MEAN stack project in my ePortfolio shows that my ability to work is serviceable. From server-side routing with Express and Node.js 
                to frontend state management with Angular to database operations with MongoDB, I developed a familiarity and understanding of how modern 
                web application function as overall.
            </p>
            <p>
                Database management, in particular, required shifting my mindset from viewing databases as just data storage to understanding them as 
                something that needs careful planning in terms of design optimizations, and security considerations. Implementing a Mongoose schema 
                validation taught me that data integrity isn’t just about preventing bad data from entering the system, it’s about making invalid states 
                impossible to present in the first place; by moving validation logic from controllers directly into schemas, I created a more maintainable 
                architecture where industry standard rules are enforced consistently across all code paths. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The frontend work taught me that software engineering extends beyond just backend logic. Solving the CSS layout issues in my admin interface 
                required the same systematic debugging approach that would be required for any algorithmic problem: Forming predictions of future problems, 
                testing incrementally, and understanding whether or not a system will be “future proofed”. This harkens to a concept of static-vs-dynamic 
                content, and how a UI or a system of any kind would react to transitions in its data, whether its additions would introduce stability issues, 
                with demonstrates foresight in potential problems. 
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="Security">
            <h3>Security Mindset:</h3>
            <p>
                Security is supposed to be something that’s implemented into the system from the beginning, not bolted onto a project as an afterthought. 
                This was something I learned after various enhancements focused around the subject.
            </p>
            <p>
                Implementing NoSQL injection protection in the project required understanding of how such attacks even work. The express-mongo-sanitize 
                middleware prevents attacks by stripping MongoDB operators (like $ or &) from user input, but understanding why this matters requires 
                grasping how those commands / operators / attacks even work. Similarly, protecting against regex injection attacks meant recognizing that 
                even seemingly innocuous features like search boxes can introduce vulnerabilities if not properly secured. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The principle of defense-in-depth (implementing multiple security layers) rather than relying on a single safeguard is a reflection of 
                common engineering practices. Sanitization middleware catches, injection attempts, schema validation ensures data integrity, and proper 
                error handling prevents information leakage. No single measure if perfect, but common security practices build great muscle memory and 
                general awareness of security measures and familiarity. 
            </p>

        <section id="Portfolio Enhancements">
            <h3>Portfolio Integration and Technical Narrative:</h3>
            <p>
                The three enhancements in this ePortfolio demonstrate individual computer science competency principles across distinct domains in a single 
                project, Travlr Getaways, proving that I can systematically improve existing systems across multiple dimensions. 
            </p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
                <li>
                    <strong>Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering:</strong> Demonstrates my attention to user experience and my ability to diagnose 
                    and resolve frontend issues. I fixed a CSS layout problem and documented Material Design 3 principles, software development requires more 
                    than just functional code, it demands interfaces that users can actually navigate effectively without having to deal with eye strain, 
                    confusion, or tedious layouts.  The challenges I face, overriding Bootstrap defaults, managing CSS cascades across Angular component 
                    hierarchies, illustrating problem-solving skills that translate beyond any specific framework.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structures:</strong> showcases my ability to optimize systems for performance and usability 
                    simultaneously. Implementing text search with MongoDB indexing demonstrates understanding of how data structures affect application behavior 
                    at scale. The two-tier search algorithm (text search with regex fallback) illustrates pragmatic algorithm design: using the optimal approach 
                    when possible while maintaining flexibility for edge case. This enhancement proves I can translate theoretical computer science concepts 
                    into practical performance improvement. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Enhancement Three: Databases and Security:</strong> reflects the security mindset that distinguishes professional-grade software 
                    from academic projects. By implementing NoSQL injection protection, regex sanitization, and comprehensive schema validation, I demonstrated 
                    the ability to anticipate and mitigate security vulnerabilities before they’re exploited. Moving validation logic from controllers to schemas 
                    shows architectural maturity, understanding that good design makes entire categories of bugs impossible rather than just catching specific errors.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="Summary">
            
        <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>
                Together, these enhancements tell a story on how I can build full-stack applications that are not only functional but also performant, maintainable, 
                secure, and user-friendly. each enhancement addresses a different facet of professional software development, yet they all reinforce the same core 
                principle of quality software requirements.
            </p>
            <p>
                As I transition from student to working the field, I the bigger showcase of this project is more in line with my ability to learn rapidly. I enjoy 
                technology and approaching problems symmetrically. my interest in UI/UX design and frontend development makes a good candite for roles that require 
                bridging technical implementations with user needs. I’m particularly drawn to work where I can apply my analytical thinking to improve how people 
                interact with software whether that’s optimizing interface workflows implementing intuitive navigation systems, or solving complicated UX problems. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In a way this ePortfolio isn’t so much an endpoint but a starting point instead, the skills demonstrated here isn’t mainly full stack development, 
                algorithmic thinking, security consciousness, and user-centered design, but my continuation to evolve as I encounter and learn more about the field 
                of computer science and technologies. What remain constant is my commitment to build software that solves real problems effectively, efficiently, and 
                with proper collaboration and communication.
