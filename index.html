            <h3>Intro</h3>
            <p>
                Completing Computer Science at Southern New Hampshire has honestly felt like a much-needed introduction to the field. I’ve only scratched the surface, 
                which is indicative to how I felt when I graduated from The University of Texas in San Antonio with a Mechanical Engineering degree, the only difference 
                is that I have more motivation to dig deeper into the concepts, as I find computers, modern technology, software-based problem solving to be more inline 
                with my creative interests and analytical strengths. 
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="collaboration">
            <h3>Collaboration and Stakeholder Communication</h3>
            <p>
                On the communication through coding side throughout the program, I’ve gained a consistent narrative amongst many instructors and tutors, that I should 
                prioritize writing code with clear, contextual comments, not just for my future self, but for the potential that anyone else who might want to read my 
                code will want to understand it thoroughly. I’ve learned that good commenting and method naming isn’t about explaining what the code does, but rather 
                explaining in a way that’s easy to digest, quick, and easy to familiarize and navigate. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Various courses have also invested time into having me familiarize myself with GitHub’s collaborative features, Pages for portfolio hosting, Copilot for 
                assisted development, branch management, and pull request workflows, even though I haven’t yet used these in team contexts, I at least understand the 
                tools and can conceptualize collaborative efforts that can be integrated into development between teams effectively.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, I intend to prepare for collaborative environments by studying real-world documentation practices. I’ve begun analyzing publicly available 
                freeware projects and codebases from companies in my area that are actively hiring on Indeed, examining their documentation styles, code comment 
                structures, and whatever architectural structure that I can find. My goal is to familiarize myself with industry-standard practices before entering 
                professional settings. This is advice along with continuing my education through personal projects that is consistently given to me through social media, 
                and it’s a lucrative way to improve and demonstrate my skills collaborative codebases when the opportunity arises.

        <section id="Data S+A">
            <h3>Data Structures and Algorithms:</h3>
            <p>
                My understanding of algorithms was primarily done through the course CS-255 System Analysis and Design, it was where Big O notation, tree structures, 
                and search algorithms was introduced. I only studied it on a surface level, and was only able to apply it to practical applications like simple database 
                retrieval methods and my personal Travlr Getaway MEAN-stack project that I did in my full-stack course via MongoDB text indexes implementations to optimize 
                queries from an O(n) to Log( n) complexity. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I’m aware that simply knowing binary search trees and hash tables exist is just a first step, what matters more is understanding why they’re useful and when 
                and when not to use them, or where their strengths and weaknesses lie, outside of the curriculum I discovered bitmasking as a strong solution for managing 
                multiple Boolean flags effectively.
            </p>
            <p>
                bitmasking is a strategy to manage multiple true/false states in an optimized way. For example, in a video game setting with user permissions like (canEdit, 
                canDelete, isAdmin), traditional implementations might store four separate Boolean fields for the permission table, but bitmasking can do all four stages with 
                a single string: for example a file can be stored as 0b1010, which would loosely translate to canEdit=true, canDelete=false, canShare=true, isAdmin=false. Or in 
                other words, checking a permission becomes a simple O(1) operation because it’s just scanning the location and binary option (0 or 1) or the string.
            </p>
            <p>
                This technique would be particularly valuable in systems handling real-time state updates, such as multiplayer game servers tracking thousands of player states 
                simultaneously, or role-based access control systems where permission checks occur on every API request. The memory efficiency and computational speed of bitwise 
                operations make them ideal for high-throughput scenarios where traditional boolean fields or relational lookups would create bottlenecks. While I haven't implemented 
                bitmasking in production code yet, understanding these advanced optimization patterns is just one useful tool in a sea full of other advance coding techniques, and 
                there will always be room to learn more.

        <section id="Database Management">
            <h3>Software Engineering and Database Management:</h3>
            <p>
                The MEAN stack project in my ePortfolio shows that my ability to work is serviceable. From server-side routing with Express and Node.js to frontend state management with 
                Angular to database operations with MongoDB, I developed a familiarity and understanding of how modern web applications function and how to navigate their internal workings 
                through its file structure / architecture.
            </p>
            <p>
                Database management, in particular, required shifting my mindset from viewing databases as just data storage to understanding them as something that needs careful planning 
                in terms of design optimizations, and security considerations. Implementing a Mongoose schema validation taught me that data integrity isn’t just about preventing bad data 
                from entering the system, it’s about making invalid states impossible to present in the first place; by moving validation logic from controllers directly into schemas, I 
                created a more maintainable architecture where industry standard rules are enforced consistently across all code paths. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The frontend work taught me that software engineering extends beyond just backend logic. Solving the CSS layout issues in my admin interface required the same systematic 
                debugging approach that would be required for any algorithmic problem: Forming predictions of future problems, testing incrementally, and understanding whether or not a 
                system will be “future proofed”. This harkens to a concept of static-vs-dynamic content, and how a UI or a system of any kind would react to transitions in its data, whether 
                its additions would introduce stability issues, with demonstrates foresight in potential problems. 
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="Security">
            <h3>Security Mindset:</h3>
            <p>
                Security is supposed to be something that’s implemented into the system from the beginning, not bolted onto a project as an afterthought. It’s arguable whether or not I learned 
                this a long time ago, but it’s a skill that many beginners have to consider when familiarizing themselves with code structures.
            </p>
            <p>
                Implementing NoSQL injection protection in the project required understanding of how such attacks even work. The express-mongo-sanitize middleware prevents attacks by stripping 
                MongoDB operators (like $ or &) from user inputs, but understanding why this matters requires grasping how those commands / operators / attacks even work. Similarly, protecting 
                against regex injection attacks meant recognizing that even seemingly innocuous features like search boxes can introduce vulnerabilities if not properly secured. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The principle of defense-in-depth (implementing multiple security layers) rather than relying on a single safeguard is a reflection of common engineering practices. Sanitization 
                middleware catches, injection attempts, schema validation ensures data integrity, and proper error handling prevents information leakage. No single measure if perfect, but common 
                security practices build great muscle memory and general awareness of security measures and familiarity. 
            </p>

        <section id="Portfolio Enhancements">
            <h3>Portfolio Integration and Technical Narrative:</h3>
            <p>
                The three enhancements in this ePortfolio demonstrate individual computer science competency principles across distinct domains in a single project, Travlr Getaways, proving that 
                I can systematically improve existing systems across multiple dimensions. 
            </p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
                <li>
                    <strong>Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering:</strong> Demonstrates my attention to user experience and my ability to diagnose and resolve frontend issues. I fixed 
                    a CSS layout problem and documented Material Design 3 principles, software development requires more than just functional code, it demands that interfaces are proper for users 
                    so they can navigate lists effectively without having to deal with eye strain, confusion, or tedious layouts.  The challenges I face, overriding Bootstrap defaults, managing 
                    CSS cascades across Angular component hierarchies, and planning ahead with dynamic layouts illustrates problem-solving skills for the medium.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structures:</strong> showcases my ability to optimize systems for performance and usability simultaneously. Implementing text search 
                    with MongoDB indexing demonstrates understanding of how data structures affect application behavior at scale. The two-tier search algorithm (text search with regex fallback) 
                    illustrates pragmatic algorithm design: using the optimal approach when possible while maintaining flexibility for edge cases. This enhancement proves I can translate theoretical 
                    computer science concepts into practical performance improvements.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Enhancement Three: Databases and Security:</strong> reflects the security mindset that distinguishes professional-grade software from academic projects. By implementing 
                    NoSQL injection protection, regex sanitization, and comprehensive schema validation, I demonstrated the ability to anticipate and mitigate security vulnerabilities before they’re 
                    exploited. Moving validation logic from controllers to schemas shows architectural maturity, understanding that good design makes entire categories of bugs impossible rather than 
                    just catching specific errors.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="Summary">
            
        <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>
                Together, these enhancements tell a story on how I can build full-stack applications that are not only functional but also performant, maintainable, secure, and user-friendly. each 
                enhancement addresses a different facet of professional software development, yet they all reinforce the same core principle of quality software requirements.
            </p>
            <p>
                As I transition from student to working the field, the bigger showcase of this project is more in line with my ability to learn rapidly. I enjoy technology and approaching problems 
                symmetrically. my interest in UI/UX design and frontend development makes a good candite for roles that require bridging technical implementations with user needs. I’m particularly 
                drawn to work where I can apply my analytical thinking to improve how people interact with software whether that’s optimizing interface workflows implementing intuitive navigation 
                systems, or solving complicated UX problems. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In a way this ePortfolio isn’t so much an endpoint but a starting point instead, the skills demonstrated here isn’t mainly full stack development, algorithmic thinking, security 
                consciousness, and user-centered design, but my continuation to evolve as I encounter and learn more about the field of computer science and technologies. What remains constant is 
                my commitment to build software that solves real problems effectively, efficiently, and with proper collaboration and communication.
