            <h3>Artifact Description</h3>
            <p>
                The artifact I selected for the Algorithms and Data Structure category is still the Travlr Getaways, full-stack 
                travel booking application, which I originally developed in CS 465 (Full Stack Development I) last semester. Again, 
                Travlr Getaways is a MEAN stack application consisting of a customer-facing website built with Express and Handlebars, 
                a RESTful API powered by Node.js and MongoDB, and an Angular-based administrative single-page application for managing 
                trip listings.
            </p>

            <p>
                last week I added improvements to the UI removing several glitches and poor UI quality, now I’m working on the algorithms 
                part, it consisted of basic CRUD operations for trip management, user authentication with JWT tokens, and server-side rendering 
                for the customer-facing pages. However, it lacked any search or filtering capabilities, forcing users to manually scroll through 
                all available trips to find destinations matching their interests.

                I selected this artifact because it provided a great opportunity to demonstrate my understanding of data structures and algorithm 
                optimization through the implementations of database indexing and search algorithms. The enhancement involved several things that 
                I’ve done in terms of algorithms and data structures:
            </p>

            <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
              <li>
                <strong>•	Database Indexing Strategy:</strong> I implemented an indexing strategy on MongoDB collections to optimize query 
                performance. Specifically, I added single-field indexes on the ‘code’ and ‘name’ fields, along with a text index spanning the 
                ‘nabe’, ‘resort’ and description fields. With this I’m able to show that I understand how Binary-search-trees (which MongoDB 
                uses for indexes) can reduce / optimize query time complexity from O(n) to O(log n).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Search Algorithm Implementation:</strong> The search system utilizes two different algorithm approaches. The primary 
                one is MongoDB’s text search algorithm, which leverages the text index to perform full text searches with word stemming and 
                word relevance. When text search returns no results, the system falls back to a regex-based pattern matching algorithm that 
                searches across multiple fields using OR operations. This fallback ensures that it works similar to other search systems so 
                like for example (if “reef” is typed it populates things with “reef” in it like “Dawson’s Reefs”).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Query Optimization:</strong> The search endpoint demonstrates algorithmic thinking in how queries are structured. Rather 
                than retrieving all documents and filtering in application code, the search pushes filtering logic to the database layer where 
                indexes can be leveraged. The API endpoint also implements relevance scoring through MongoDB’s $meta:”textScore” functionality, 
                sorting results by relevance rather than arbitrary order.
              </li>
            </ul>
